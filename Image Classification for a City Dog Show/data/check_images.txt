Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed?
Answer:
• All three models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) mostly agreed on the breeds of the dog images except for one notable exception:
• For the image Basenji_00964.jpg, ResNet and VGG classified it correctly as "basenji," but AlexNet misclassified it as "italian greyhound."
• For the other dog images, the models correctly classified the breeds consistently.
2. Did each of the three model architectures classify Dog_02.jpg to be the same breed of dog as Dog_01.jpg?
Answer:
• Assuming Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg correspond to pairs like Basenji_00964.jpg and Basenji_00963.jpg (since only 7 images total), ResNet and VGG classified both consistently as "basenji."
• AlexNet misclassified one Basenji image but correctly classified the other, so AlexNet did not consistently classify the breed between Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg.
3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs?
Answer:
• ResNet misclassified the cat image (cat_01.jpg) as a dog breed (norwegian elkhound, elkhound), so it failed to correctly identify the cat as not a dog.
• AlexNet correctly classified both cat_01.jpg and sports_car_01.jpg as not dogs.
• VGG also correctly classified both cat_01.jpg and sports_car_01.jpg as not dogs (classified cat as lynx and sports car as a vehicle, not a dog).
4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
Answer:
• VGG is the best performing model on the uploaded images because it:
• Correctly classified all dog images’ breeds (100% breed accuracy).
• Correctly identified all non-dog images as not dogs (100% accuracy on not-a-dog classification).
• Did not misclassify any dogs or non-dogs.
• ResNet had perfect breed classification but failed to identify the cat image as not a dog.
• AlexNet misclassified one Basenji as a different dog breed and otherwise performed well, but not as well as VGG overall.
